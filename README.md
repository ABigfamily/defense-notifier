# defense-notifier
Simple Defense Notifier for ROBLOX clans

## Setup
If you want this to work, all you'll need is a Discord Webhook, set up to the channel you want the notifier to post in. You can read more about these here: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks.

Once you've gotten that, you can grab your group's ID, and you're all set. Just decide on what message you want the bot to send, and it'll work flawlessly.

## Usage
To have the bot function, you can make one script, and put it within the ServerScriptStorage. If you have any questions, feel free to DM ts#1329
